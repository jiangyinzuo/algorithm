Let's consider some math problems.

JSZKC has a set A={1,2,...,N}A=\{1,2,...,N\}A={1,2,...,N}. He defines a subset of AAA as 'Meo set' if there doesn't exist two integers in this subset with difference one. For example, When A={1,2,3},{1},{2},{3},{1,3}A=\{1,2,3\}, \{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,3\}A={1,2,3},{1},{2},{3},{1,3} are 'Meo set'.

For each 'Meo set', we can calculate the product of all the integers in it. And then we square this product. At last, we can sum up all the square result of the 'Meo set'.

So please output the final result.
Input Format

The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

    The first line of the input contains one integers NNN (1≤N≤100)(1 \le N \le 100)(1≤N≤100), giving the size of the set.

There are no more than 100100100 test cases.
Output Format

One line per case, an integer indicates the answer.
